# Yet another oUF Layout.

__This is a WIP addon, expect changes and unfinished (like a lot) of things. I'm still learning and gathering ideas as I progress. It's usable, not finished.__

_This addon is done for my own interface and preferences, so without finishing it, don't expect to be editable as other addons.
For now you have to edit Layout.lua to make any change, with time it will have a friendly configuration UI.
The very reason to upload this is to hold the name of addon._

# Grump Unit Frames for grumpy people. 

* Player
* Target
* Target of Target
* Focus
* Buffs and Debuffs (unfiltered)
* 3D Portrait (no 2D for now, only available editing files, future will give option to turn on or off).

__More importantly, my AddOn is free to be forked and modified as you see fit, with due credits of my AddOn, you cannot claim authorship of this base code. (Lame while I put license in order).__
