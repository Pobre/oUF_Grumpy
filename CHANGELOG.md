# CHANGELOG
----
### Revision: 95
* New Layout, which won't stay. I'm releasing this version just so people can work from it if they have any idea to make it better. New versions will have new layout.

### Revision: 85
* Portrait has been hidden. The code is still there, but I intend to make it optional with a configuration file/interface in a future version.
* Names of small frames still need to clip long names. Already being develop (have the code testing now), just won't release until I'm satisfied with my work.
* Last version for traditional HP bars, future releases will only include the redesign of UI. Look up on screenshots to see how r85 looks.

### Revision: 71
* Fix Target cast bar wrong parenting.

### Revision: 70
* Font added and now readable.

### Revision: 66
* AddOn launch.
